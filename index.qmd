<p class="hello">Hi! I am Favian Alexander Hatje!</p>

I am a radiologist with a passion for science and technology. I have many interests, but I am particularly drawn to the field of artificial intelligence. I am based in Berlin, Germany, where I work for [Ihre-Radiologen](https://ihre-radiologen.de).

My journey began in Hamburg, where I studied medicine, complemented by one year of full-time work in a [physiology lab](http://meyerschwesingerlab.de/). There, my colleagues and I developed a method for extracting large quantities of glomerular cells from mice, which resulted in a [publication in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (JASN)](https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/32/9/2175), a renowned journal in the field of nephrology.

I then made my way to Berlin, where I began my career as a radiologist. By day, I am busy reading CT and MRI studies, at night I enjoy exploring the limitless possibilities and incredible developments of artificial intelligence. Through continued self-study through courses like [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) and [Deep Learning for Medicine on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine), I have deepened my understanding of this exciting field, and I regularly participate in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/favianh) competitions to hone my skills.
